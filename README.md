# NFL Draft Prediction with Combine Data
This project leverages NFL Combine data spanning the past decade to predict which players are likely to get drafted into the NFL based solely on their performance during the Combine.

## Key Achievements
- Achieved a 74% accuracy rate using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm.
- Utilized combine events with quantifiable metrics such as 40-yard dash times and bench press repetitions.
- Explored correlations between combine performance metrics and draft outcomes, focusing exclusively on measurable data points.

## Limitations
- The prediction model was restricted to using quantitative combine metrics due to the inability to factor in player-specific skills and intangibles.
- Future iterations aim to incorporate additional data sources and refine the model to improve accuracy and predictive capabilities.
- This project serves as a foundational exploration into using data-driven approaches to forecast NFL draft prospects based on their combine performance.
